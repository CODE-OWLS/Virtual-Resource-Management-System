# Code Owls - VRMS 
Our first Semester project based on python and tinkercad

Our project aims to cater to the needs of the students and teachers, who are left largely depended on virtual classroom environments. Managing all the resources which were once physical and could be sorted easily are now a hassle to sort. Students can no longer meet and greet each other as they would have done, had there been no pandemic. Sitting in front of a screen for large durations is not only physically exhausting but has given birth to unprecedented rates of mental health issues. 

Though no one would be able to simulate the physical classes we can try to make the online experience better and more fun to use. This project impacts students and teachers, offering them easier access to resources and helps with doubt clearing. It also functions as a library to access all sorts of books, documents, news and recording of lectures. The aims can be achieved by use of simple applications like a graphical interface, a profile system and a portal to important resources. 

It also consists of some extra features like some basic games to refresh your mind and take a break, along with some tools like a simple calculator and a weather app.
